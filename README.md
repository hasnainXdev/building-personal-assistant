# Build Your AI Agents

This project is a starting point for building AI agents using the OpenAI library. It provides a simple framework for creating and training agents to perform various tasks such as text classification, object detection, and more.

The project includes a sample agent that can be used as a starting point for building your own agents. The agent is trained to classify text as either positive or negative.

To get started, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in the root of the project.
